= Example Document Template
:page-weight: 100

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

When creating new documentation stores for a project it is often helpful to
provide a standard template which can be used as a starting point for new
files. This example template demonstrates how such a file could be structured
and what types of information it may contain. Utilizing a template is not
required but can be useful in providing an easy start for new contributors.

It is also very useful to specify the format of the document and point to
references for further instruction. For example, this document uses the
AsciiDoc format and you are free to use any of the available markup
(see https://asciidoc.org/).

If you plan to use a document template, you will most likely want to call out
its usage in your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. This can take the form of
instructions for creating new content to copy the example template and fill
in all the appropriate sections. In this manner you can quickly and easily
create a unifying format for your documents.

[[content]]
== Content Sections

One very useful method for structuring an example template is to create the
section titles that you will expect to be found in the final documents. Within
each section you can provide relevant information about what the author should
write.

You may notice that this section begins with a statement enclosed in square
braces `[[content]]`. This statement will instruct the AsciiDoc tooling to
create an HTML `id` tag in the header. Adding these identifier statements can
be very useful for building richly linked documents that contain references
directly to the sections.

[[metadata]]
== Metadata

Another common task is to include metadata with a document. This metadata can
be used by the static site generator to change behavior or simply to provide
deeper attributions. AsciiDoc provides attribute entity blocks to allow this
type of customization.

You may have noticed the `:page-weight:` directive immediately after the title
element. This is an example of how we can use the attribute blocks to define
variables that will change the behavior of our site render. In this case the
variable allows us to determine the ordering for document display in the
`index.html` file.

For a deeper discussion of how these variables can be used please see the
http://asciidoc.org/asciidoc.css-embedded.html#X18[AsciiDoc Attribute Entry documentation]
and the https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc#page-attributes[Jekyll-AsciiDoc Page attributes documentation].

[[other-content]]
== Other content

Document contributors will often need to include content that is difficult
to recreate is AsciiDoc or requires special markup. The example template is
a perfect place to illustrate how this content should be added.

For example, if we would like to instruct future contributors about adding
images to their document we might add the following:

If you wish to include an image in your document, add the image file to the
root `assets` directory in this repository and then reference it in your
document with the following statement:

```
image:/assets/my_image.png[Alt text]
```

Alternatively, if you wish to use HTML markup you could use this format:

```
pass:[<img src="/assets/my_image.png" alt="Alt text" class="some-class">]
```

In this manner you can create rich documentation about adding content to
documents, and help to enforce consistency of usage for all contributors.
